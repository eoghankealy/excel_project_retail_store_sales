# üßπ Retail Store Sales Data Cleaning & Excel Dashboard

## üìò Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a messy retail sales dataset from Kaggle, transforming it into a structured, validated, and interactive Excel dashboard.  
The aim was to practice real-world data cleaning, explore sales performance by product category, and develop a clear, data-driven visualization of retail trends.

**Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel (Mac)  
**Total Records:** 12,575

## üßº Data Cleaning Summary

| Column | Missing Values | Action Taken |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Quantity | 604 | Rows removed (same rows with blanks as Total Spent) |
| Total Spent | 604 | Removed same rows as Quantity |
| Price per Unit | 609 | Filled using Total Spent √∑ Quantity |
| Item | 1,213 | Inferred using Category & Price |
| Discount Applied | 4,199 | Left blank as unclear meaning |

## üßÆ Cleaning Highlights

- Converted dates to `YYYY-MM-DD`  
- Set proper data types and formatting  
- Checked for duplicates  
- Filled ‚ÄúPrice per Unit‚Äù blanks using:

```excel
=[Total Spent]/[Quantity]
```


- When filtering for Category and Price all non blank Item cells have the same Item name for a particular price (no two items in the data set had the same price), therefore it can be reasonably assumed the blanks in Item Name should have that same name as the other items for that price and category.

- Used XLOOKUP to fill missing Item names:

```
=IF(D2<>"", D2, XLOOKUP(1,(C:C=C2)*(E:E=E2)*(D:D<>""),D:D))
```

- Removed 604 rows from the data that had both Quantity and Total Spent missing as amounted to less than 5% of Dataset
