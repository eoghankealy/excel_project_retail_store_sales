## üßÆ Cleaning Highlights

- Converted dates to `YYYY-MM-DD`  
- Set proper data types and formatting  
- Checked for duplicates  
- Filled ‚ÄúPrice per Unit‚Äù blanks using:

```excel
=[Total Spent]/[Quantity]
```


- When filtering for Category and Price all non blank Item cells have the same Item name, therefore it can be assumed the blanks should have that same name
- Used XLOOKUP to fill missing Item names:

```
=IF(D2<>"", D2, XLOOKUP(1,(C:C=C2)*(E:E=E2)*(D:D<>""),D:D))
```

- Removed 604 rows with both Quantity and Total Spent missing as amounted to less than 5% of Dataset
